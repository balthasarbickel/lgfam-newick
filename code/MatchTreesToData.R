# Functions for pruning lgfam trees (Dediu 2015, https://github.com/ddediu/lgfam-newick) 
# so that the tips match the data we have, based on an ID of choice (ISO, AUTOTYP or GLOTTOLOG IDs)
# 
# Because data can be collected at various taxonomic levels (e.g. at the dialect or the language level),
# it sometimes happens that we have data on nodes rather than tips in a tree, e.g. we might have data 
# for German but our tree ends in tips that represent only the dialects German. 
# This creates a problem for all functions that expect data to match tips only (e.g. virtually all
# phylogenetic methods in `ape' or `geiger'). 
# To maximize data usage, we fill the tips that lack data with the ID of the next higher node. 
# This is justified on the assumption that one would have gathered data from the daugthers of this node 
# if one suspected strong variation. 
# In the absence of this, it is reasonable to assume that the data of the mother node are also 
# characteristic of the daughters. This idea is implemented in the function fill.tree() which takes 
# a list of trees or a multiPhylo object, based on various language identifiers, as specified by the 
# "id.type" argument. 
# 
# *************************************************************************************************
# NOTE: the UULID type here only collects ISO, AUTOTYP and GLOTTOCODE, not WALS IDs because we have 
# no data with WALS IDs. This is different from the original UULID in Dan's data, but matches our 
# present data format.
# And it requires preprocessing to harmonize with my data (see lines 41ff below)
# ***********************************************************************************************
#
# The second function, prune.to.data(), prunes the trees to retain only tips with data.
#
# MAY CONTAIN BUGS. USE WITH CARE!
